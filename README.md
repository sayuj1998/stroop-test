# Stroop Test Game

A cognitive psychology experiment built in Python using Pygame, designed to measure reaction time and cognitive interference (based on the classic Stroop effect).

## How It Works

Participants are shown color names (like "RED" or "GREEN") rendered in a font color that may not match the word itself. The task is to **click the button that matches the **font color**, not the word**.

Reaction times are recorded for each trial, and incorrect answers are tracked. Results are saved to a local text file.
